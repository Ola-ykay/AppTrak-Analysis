## üéØProject Overview
AppTrak Analysis is a personal data analytics project that tracks and visualizes how I use applications on my phone. Using a custom iOS shortcut, the project logs each app session‚Äôs details (date, time, location, network type, battery status) and automatically saves them into a CSV file. This dataset is then transformed into an interactive Excel dashboard for analysis.

## üìåGoal
To analyze my own app usage data and discover patterns in how, when and where I use different apps.

## ‚úÖObjectives
- To build a custom app usage dataset directly from my phone
- To clean and enrich data for deeper analysis
- To visualize insights to understand usage by:
  1. Location
  2. Weekday
  3. Daytime
  4. Battery status
  5. Network details/type
  6. Monthly trends
- To identify habits and potential areas for digital well-being improvements.

 ## üõ†Tools Used
  - iOS Shortcuts: manual logging of app usage
  - iCloud Drive: storing the csv log file
  - Excel: data analysis and dashboard creation
  - Power Query: data cleaning and transformation

  ## üîÑData Preparation
  - Built a custom shortcut to run when opening some apps 
  - Collected
    - Application name
    - Date & time
    - Location (city)
    - Network details (Wi-Fi/mobile)
    - Battery status
  - Saved each log entry to a csv file on iCloud Drive
  - Imported csv into Excel
  - Used power query to:
     1. Remove duplicates and fix column types
     2. Add weekday, month and daytime segment columns. 
  - Built an Excel Dashboard with:
     1. Pivot tables
     2. Slicers
